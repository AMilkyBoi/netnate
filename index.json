[{"content":"Theory Step 1: Particle Characteristics Each particle is treated as a point mass, and each point mass has three intrinsic characteristics:\na mass \\(m_i\\), a position vector \\(\\vec{r}_i=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}x_i \u0026amp; y_i \u0026amp; z_i\\end{array}\\right]\\), and a velocity vector \\(\\vec{v}_i=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}u_i \u0026amp; v_i \u0026amp; w_i\\end{array}\\right]\\). Step 2: Force Calculation According to Newton\u0026rsquo;s law of universal gravitation, given two distinct point masses in space, the gravitational force acting on the objects takes the form:\n$$F=G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$\nwhere:\n\\(F\\) is the common force between the masses, \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(m_1\\) is the first mass, \\(m_2\\) is the second mass, and \\(r\\) is the distance between the centers of the masses. However, this formula is only applicable to isolated two-body systems. Therefore, in order to consider \\(N\\) number of point masses, Newton\u0026rsquo;s law of universal gravitation must be updated. This formulation is called the \\(N\\)-body problem.\nFrom Wikipedia: The \\(N\\)-body problem considers \\(N\\) point masses \\(m_i,i=1,2,\u0026hellip;,N\\) in an inertial reference frame in three-dimensional space \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) moving under the influence of mutual gravitational attraction. In other words, the \\(N\\) body problem expands Newton\u0026rsquo;s law of universal gravitation to work with any amount of point masses.\nThe gravitational force felt on mass \\(m_i\\) by a single other mass \\(m_j\\) is:\n$$\\vec{F}_i=G\\frac{m_im_j}{\\left|\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right|^2}⋅\\frac{\\left(\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right)}{\\left|\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right|}=G\\frac{m_im_j\\left(\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right)}{\\left|\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right|^3}$$\nwhere:\n\\(F_i\\) is the force felt on mass \\(m_i\\) due to mass \\(m_j\\), \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(m_i\\) is the first mass, \\(m_j\\) is the second mass, and \\(\\left|\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right|\\) is the magnitude of the distance between \\(\\vec{r}_j\\) and \\(\\vec{r}_i\\) induced by the \\(l_2\\) norm. In order to obtain the equations of motion for each particle in the system, the previous equation must be summed for a total of \\(N\\) times per particle:\n$$\\vec{F}i=G\\sum{\\substack{j=1\\j\\not{}i}}^N\\frac{m_im_j\\left(\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right)}{\\left|\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right|^3}$$\nStep 3: Acceleration Calculation Given the summation form of Newton\u0026rsquo;s law of gravitation for the \\(N\\)-body problem, solving for the acceleration of a particle is a trivial task. The discretized vector form of Newton\u0026rsquo;s second law for a mass \\(m_i\\) can be written as:\n$$\\vec{F}_i=m_i\\vec{a}_i→\\vec{a}_i=\\frac{\\vec{F}_i}{m_i}$$\nTherefore:\n$$\\vec{a}i=G\\sum{\\substack{j=1\\j\\not{}i}}^N\\frac{m_j\\left(\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right)}{\\left|\\vec{r}_j-\\vec{r}_i\\right|^3}$$\nNumerical Implementation 1 x = 1 ","permalink":"https://www.netnate.com/posts/engineering/aerospace/nbody/","summary":"Theory Step 1: Particle Characteristics Each particle is treated as a point mass, and each point mass has three intrinsic characteristics:\na mass \\(m_i\\), a position vector \\(\\vec{r}_i=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}x_i \u0026amp; y_i \u0026amp; z_i\\end{array}\\right]\\), and a velocity vector \\(\\vec{v}_i=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}u_i \u0026amp; v_i \u0026amp; w_i\\end{array}\\right]\\).
